## Evaluation Methodology

All evaluations follow a structured technical audit process:

1. **Code Analysis**: Reviewing code structure, modularity, and quality
2. **Functionality Testing**: Verifying core requirements and features
3. **Performance Evaluation**: Assessing speed, scalability, and efficiency
4. **Security Assessment**: Checking for vulnerabilities and best practices
5. **User Experience**: Evaluating interface design and usability
6. **Architecture Review**: Analyzing system design and deployment patterns

## Scoring System

Each project is evaluated on a 10-point scale with the following categories:
- **Functionality** (30%) - Core feature implementation
- **Code Quality** (25%) - Modularity, readability, and best practices
- **Performance** (20%) - Speed and efficiency
- **Security** (15%) - Vulnerability assessment
- **UI/UX** (10%) - User interface and experience

## Getting Started

To review the evaluations:
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Open the corresponding `student_evaluation.md` or report file
3. Review the detailed findings, score breakdown, and recommendations
